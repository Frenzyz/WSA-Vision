Help: Open opens files from a shell.
      By default, opens each file using the default application for that file.  
      If the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a URL.
Options: 
      -a                    Opens with the specified application.
      --arch ARCH           Open with the given cpu architecture type and subtype.

      -R, --reveal          Selects in the Finder instead of opening.
      -W, --wait-apps       Blocks until the used applications are closed (even if they were already running).
          --args            All remaining arguments are passed in argv to the application's main() function instead of opened.
      -n, --new             Open a new instance of the application even if one is already running.
      -j, --hide            Launches the app hidden.
      -g, --background      Does not bring the application to the foreground.
      -h, --header          Searches header file locations for headers matching the given filenames, and opens them.
      -s                    For -h, the SDK to use; if supplied, only SDKs whose names contain the argument value are searched.
                            Otherwise the highest versioned SDK in each platform is used.
      -u, --url URL         Open this URL, even if it matches exactly a filepath
      -i, --stdin  PATH     Launches the application with stdin connected to PATH; defaults to /dev/null
