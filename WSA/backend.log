Goal: close Spotify. We need to break down into actionable tasks. The tasks should describe steps to close Spotify on macOS. Possibly use 'open -a Spotify' to open, but closing? Could use 'killall Spotify' or 'osascript'. But must use only open -a? The instructions say \"When starting applications, always use the 'open -a appname' format\" So only for opening. For closing, we can use 'killall Spotify' or 'osascript -e' but we should keep description only, no code.\n\nWe need tasks like \"Open Terminal\", \"Use killall to close Spotify\". But the description should be in natural language. Probably two tasks: \"Open Terminal\" and \"Run command to close Spotify\". But the description should not include file paths or extensions, or any additional parameters. It must be only description, no code. So:\n\nTask 1: Open Terminal.\n\nTask 2: Close Spotify using appropriate command.\n\nBut we must not include code snippet. So description like \"Open Terminal and type 'killall Spotify' to close the application\". But that contains code. The instruction says no file paths, extensions, or additional parameters in the descriptions. \"killall Spotify\" is a command; but it's not a file path or extension. Is that allowed? It's a command. It might be considered additional parameters. But description can include commands? They didn't forbid including command names. They only forbid file paths, extensions, or any additional parameters. But including the command to close might be acceptable. But maybe safer to just say \"Close Spotify by quitting the app\" or \"Use the Quit option from the Spotify menu\". But that is not actionable for automation? But the goal is close Spotify. The steps: 1) Open Spotify, 2) Quit via menu.\n\nBut the user wants to close Spotify. So tasks: \"Open Spotify\" (to ensure it's open) then \"Use the Quit command from the menu\". But we can just do \"Quit Spotify\". That may be enough. But we need to break down into tasks.\n\nWe can provide a single task: \"Close Spotify by quitting the application\". But they want a JSON array, can have one or more tasks. Provide at least one.\n\nI'll produce:\n\n[\n {\"description\": \"Quit Spotify by selecting 'Quit Spotify' from the application menu\"},\n {\"description\": \"Verify that Spotify has stopped running\"}\n]\n\nBut description 2 might not be necessary. The instructions: break down high-level goal into actionable tasks. The tasks should be descriptive.\n\nLet's do:\n\nTask 1: Close Spotify by quitting the application.\n\nTask 2: Confirm Spotify is no longer running.\n\nNo code or file paths.

According to instructions, we need to provide a single JSON array of tasks with descriptions only. The description should use the 'open -a appname' format when starting applications. But we are closing Spotify. The goal: close Spotify. The instructions: \"When starting applications, always use the 'open -a appname' format (e.g., 'open -a TextEdit', 'open -a Spotify'). Do not include file paths, extensions, or any additional parameters in the descriptions.\" That is about starting applications. For closing, presumably we need a command to close Spotify. The usual command could be \"osascript -e 'quit app \\\"Spotify\\\"'\" or \"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"Spotify\\\" to quit'\". But the instructions didn't mention anything about closing. They only say \"When starting applications, always use 'open -a appname' format\". For closing, we might just use \"osascript -e 'quit app \\\"Spotify\\\"'\". However, the user request: \"Goal: close spotify\". We need a single task description. Let's consider the guidelines: Provide a single JSON array of tasks with descriptions only. Must not include any additional text outside JSON. So output something like:\n\n[\n  { \"description\": \"osascript -e 'quit app \\\"Spotify\\\"'\" }\n]\n\nBut check if we need to escape quotes properly in JSON. The JSON string must include backslashes. The description string will be JSON-encoded. We need to escape double quotes within the string. So it should be:\n\n{ \"description\": \"osascript -e 'quit app \\\"Spotify\\\"'\" }\n\nBut inside JSON, backslashes must be escaped. The string contains a backslash before the double quote. Actually we need to escape the backslash: \"\\\". In JSON, to include a double quote inside a string, you escape it as \\\". So inside JSON we need to have \\\"Spotify\\\". So the string will be: osascript -e 'quit app \\\"Spotify\\\"' (with backslashes before the double quotes). So the JSON should be:\n\n[\n  { \"description\": \"osascript -e 'quit app \\\\\\\"Spotify\\\\\\\"'\" }\n]\n\nWait we need to escape backslashes as well? In JSON string, a backslash is escape character, so to represent a backslash in JSON, we need to escape it as \\\\ . But we don't need a backslash before the double quote, we can escape double quote directly. Actually the string we want to produce is:\n\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Spotify\"'\n\nWe want to embed that string in JSON. The double quotes inside the string must be escaped as \\\". So the JSON string should be:\n\n\"osascript -e 'quit app \\\"Spotify\\\"'\"\n\nThus in the final JSON we have:\n\n[\n  { \"description\": \"osascript -e 'quit app \\\"Spotify\\\"'\" }\n]\n\nThat should be valid JSON. Let's double-check: The outer string is double quotes. Inside it, we have the text osascript -e 'quit app \\\"Spotify\\\"'. The double quotes inside are escaped. The single quotes around quit app \"Spotify\" are fine. So JSON is valid.\n\nWe should not add any other text. Ensure no trailing commas. Provide exactly that.\n\nThus answer: JSON array with one object.\n\n"},"done":true,"done_reason":"stop","total_duration":41191577500,"load_duration":5624658958,"prompt_eval_count":249,"prompt_eval_duration":1250510958,"eval_count":717,"eval_duration":34238531125}
